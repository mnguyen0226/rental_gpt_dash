# Property Rental Interest Prediction Web App
A software to predict how popular an apartment retal listing based onthe listing content like text description, photos, number of bedrooms, price,.... The data is provided from renthop.com, an apartment listing site with the apartments are located in New York City. Specifically, for a listing_id, we want to know whether the customer has a `low`, `medium`, or `high` interest.

Research Questions:
- 2. Model 1: Based on the tabular input of the user (without extracted features from image), can we predict the interest level. 
  - Customer: Agent
  - Classical ML.
- 3. Model 2: Based on the tabular input of the user and the image, can we predict the interest level.
  - Customer: Agent
  - Yolo
  - Classical ML
  - Dataset with images only
- 4. Model 3: Based on the input data, can we generate the image of the room?
  - Fine-tune Deep Learning
  - Customer: Agent
- 5. Model 4: Usage of ChatGPT 
  - Customer: Renter
  - Customer service bot to answer the FAQs about the NYC rental market using the dataset as knowledge base and analysis.
  - Hard: from the chat, provide the listing of the relevant property to select?

## About
### Dataset
The datasets can be found [here]((https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/two-sigma-connect-rental-listing-inquiries/data?select=train.json.zip)).
- `train.json`: the training set.
- `images_sample.zip`: listing images organized by listing_id (a sample of 100 listings)
- `Kaggle-renthop.7z`: listing images organized by listing_id. Total size: 78.5 GB compressed.

**Note**: for this project, we will consider the training dataset as a full-dataset, as our goal is not to beat the competition, but to build a tool for data analysis and usages.

## Development Phases

### Phase 1. EDA [ANALYSIS] - DONE
- Explore the dataset, reveal underlying information by plotting static plots for the following feature type, and preprocess the dataset.


### Phase 2. Data Processing [ANALYSIS] - DONE
- Data preprocessing with Pretrained model
  - Sentimental Extraction.
  - Feature Extraction
  - Image Feature Extraction

### Phase 3. ML Modeling [ANALYSIS] - DONE
- **Model 1**: Based on the tabular input of the user (without extracted features from image), can we predict the interest level. 
  - Customer: Agent
  - Classical ML.
- **Model 2**: Based on the tabular input of the user and the image, can we predict the interest level.
  - Customer: Agent
  - Yolo
  - Classical ML
  - Dataset with images only
- **Model 3**: Based on the tabular input of the user (without extracted features from image), can we predict the price. 
  - Customer: Agent + Renter
  - Classical ML.
- **Model 4**: Based on the tabular input of the user and the image, can we predict the price.
  - Customer: Agent
  - Yolo
  - Classical ML
  - Dataset with images only

### Phase 4. Dash Visualization Development [UI + ANALYSIS] - DONE
- **TODO** - DCC:
  - Check list
  - RadioItem
  - Loading
  - RangeSlider
  - Slider
  - Tooltips
  - Figure
  - Label


- **TODO from report**: Dataset analysis, convert all to plotly.
  - PCA
  - Normality Test
  - Pearson Correlation Matris
  - Statistic

- Map Visualization Based On Interest: Use dash-leaflet or plotly.express to plot rental listings on a map. Users could filter by price range, number of bedrooms/bathrooms, or interest level.
  - Slider
- Price Change Based on Interest: Interactive histograms or KDE plots for price where users can filter based on number of bedrooms, bathrooms, or location.

### Phase 5. Real-time Prediction (data, image) with Flask [UI] - Done + Class
- **Model 1**: Based on the tabular input of the user (without extracted features from image), can we predict the interest level. 
  - Customer: Agent
  - Classical ML.
- **Model 2**: Based on the tabular input of the user and the image, can we predict the interest level.
  - Customer: Agent
  - Yolo
  - Classical ML
  - Dataset with images only
- **Model 3**: Based on the tabular input of the user (without extracted features from image), can we predict the price. 
  - Customer: Agent + Renter
  - Classical ML.
- **Model 4**: Based on the tabular input of the user and the image, can we predict the price.
  - Customer: Agent
  - Yolo
  - Classical ML
  - Dataset with images only

### Phase 6. Chatbot Development
- **Model 5**: Usage of ChatGPT 
  - Customer: Renter
  - Customer service bot to answer the FAQs about the NYC rental market using the dataset as knowledge base and analysis.
  - Hard: from the chat, provide the listing of the relevant property to select?

    - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qNwoAAfnk4&t=17s
    - https://github.com/plotly/all-in-ai-demo-app
    - Fine-tune: https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/fine-tuning/use-a-fine-tuned-model
    - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTYL-lFM22k

### Phase: Property Filtering
- Interactive Table: Display a searchable and filterable table of listings where users can sort by different features like price, number of bedrooms, or interest level.
  - Filtered by listing...

### Phase 7. Mobile Development [UI + UX]
- Task 1: Upload images and make prediction (help buyer evaluate the house).
- Task 2: Image generation based on input (help client the house)

### Phase 8. PyTest 

### Phase 9. Deploy
- Will the docerization and running will actually work as the ml is trained on different environment while the model is run on different environment?
- Route of models to different folder
- Try to deploy with without database first

### Phase 10. Report & Presentation
- Create a python file for EDA

### **TODO** Designs
- Design:
  - Static + Dynamic: https://dash-molstar.everburstsun.net/drugs
  - Prediction: https://dash-molstar.everburstsun.net/drugs
  - ChatGPT: https://biomedical.dev6.rightinformation.com/genomic-analysis with listing
- Dalle is possible: As we just need to have a pre-defined prompt and allow user to choose room number... then generate image.
- All renthop image is online so we can do filtering
- ChatGPT for listing, theres a button to "List top 5" to do api call making prediction on number of room... then filter.
- **Can you prepare a document that shows the steps on the deployment process through VT server instead of GCP?**
- Add instruction and notes for each tab
- Test build on another python environment (for submission)
- **Share to BlackRock**
